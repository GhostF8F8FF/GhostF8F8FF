- 👋 Hi! I’m Ghost. I'm an aspiring ethical hacker learning full stack JavaScript development.
- 🖥️ I’m currently working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to understand web applications better.
- 📜 I'm pursuing an infosec education; my goal right now is to earn the [CBBH certification](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-bug-bounty-hunter).
- 🛡️ I’m motivated by my love for web technology and a desire to make the web a safer place.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm absolutely **delighted** by dad jokes and think they're the highest form of humor!

#### *...pssst, have a nerdy dad joke on me:*
